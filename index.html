            <p>
                I was born and raised in Bismarck, North Dakota.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1995 I picked up my life and moved to Denver, Colorado. <em>That</em> was a good decision, to say the least.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2017 I "decided" to enter the University of Denver's Full Stack Coding Bootcamp. I had been fiddling with coding for decades on my own and - in recent years - daydreaming about an opportunity like DU offered.
            </p>
            <p>
                I put the word decided in quotes above. After 21 years of being employed by a local television station, they decided they didn't need humans doing the job I did anymore and I was downsized -- into my dream opportunity.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the two decades I worked there I had my hands on all manner of broadcast technology. When I arrived on the scene it was paper logs and video tape machines. When I left the scene it was electronic logs and server-based program storage. I was at the controls for most of the Superbowl broadcasts during those two decades, including the most recent Denver Broncos Superbowl win. So yeah, that was me behind the controls safeguarding the broadcast and the investments in it while you were cheering - or cursing.
            </p>
            <p>
                How does television translate to coding? Teamwork, first and foremost. It was never articulated this way, but I always saw my job as getting everyone's work on the air the way they intended it. That required consistent, quality communication and that's why I was the preferred operator for special events.
            </p>
            <p>
                In recent years I had volunteered to work on an internal SharePoint Wiki that centralized information, standard practices and procedures. A sample of that work is available through the <a href="./portfolio.html">portfolio page.</a> I tried to write organized, DRY html code with css, but I did it all with SharePoint's code editor and it bloats code beyond all recognition. What you type into the html editor isn't what you get back when it's reopened. The SharePoint part was frustrating and yet the days I was scheduled to work on it flew by because I enjoyed the work so much. I have great passion for front end development and getting things <em>just right</em>. The aesthetic of creativity within coding's linguistic framework kept drawing me back. Sound hokey? It may be, but it's what makes being downsized into my dream opportunity a chance to make lemonade! I want to code.
            </p>
            <p>
                DU's coding bootcamp is over. I wanted - and got - a great overview of full stack web development. I discovered that I very much enjoy working with APIs and databases on the back end, but I'm more comfortable on the front end and I have a pretty good knack for troubleshooting code.
            </p>
            <p>
                I gave myself a few days off as a reward, but now I'm going to dive into every project we did to make improvements and I'm looking forward to deep diving into the concepts we covered at break-neck speed. I'll be keeping a log of improvements and additions to my work. First on the agenda is refactor these pages and implement handlebars templates.
