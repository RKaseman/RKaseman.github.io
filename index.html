            <p>
                I was born and raised in Bismarck, North Dakota.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1995 I picked up my life and moved to Denver, Colorado. <em>That</em> was a good decision, to say the least.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2017 I "decided" to enter the University of Denver's Full Stack Coding Bootcamp. I had been fiddling with coding for decades on my own and - in recent years - daydreaming about an opportunity like DU offered.
            </p>
            <p>
                I put the word decided in quotes above. After 21 years of being employed by a local television station, they decided they didn't need humans doing the job I did anymore and I was downsized -- into my dream opportunity.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the two decades I worked there I had my hands on all manner of broadcast technology. When I arrived on the scene it was paper logs and video tape machines. When I left the scene it was electronic logs and server-based program storage. In short, I was responsible for getting everyone's work on the air how and when they intended it. The most recent event of significance I was responsible for was the Denver Broncos last Superbowl win. So yeah, that was me behind the controls safeguarding the broadcast and the investments in it while you were cheering - or cursing.
            </p>
            <p>
                In recent years I had volunteered to work on an internal SharePoint Wiki that centralized information, standard practices and procedures. A sample of that work will be available to view as soon as I can get to it. I did it all with SharePoint's code editor and the days I was scheduled to work on it flew by because I enjoyed the work so much. I have great passion for front end development and getting things <em>just right</em>. Sound hokey? It's not. It's what makes being downsized into my dream opportunity a chance to make lemonade!
            </p>
            <p>
                The disclaimer to please be patient as my work gets more refined is in full force. I have plans for this site, so stay tuned.
