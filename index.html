            <p>
                I was born and raised in Bismarck, North Dakota.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1995 I picked up my life and moved to Denver, Colorado. <em>That</em> was a good decision, to say
                the least.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2017 I "decided" to enter the University of Denver's Full Stack Coding Bootcamp. I had been fiddling
                with coding for decades on my own and - in recent years - daydreaming about an opportunity like DU
                offered.
            </p>
            <p>
                I put the word decided in quotes above. After 21 years of being employed by a local television station,
                they decided they didn't need humans doing the job I did anymore and I was downsized -- into my dream
                opportunity.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the two decades I worked there I had my hands on all manner of broadcast technology. When I arrived
                on the scene it was paper logs and video tape machines. When I left the scene it was electronic logs
                and server-based program storage. In short, I was responsible for getting everyone's work on the air
                how and when they intended it. The most recent event of significance I was responsible for was the
                Denver Broncos last Superbowl win. So yeah, that was me behind the controls safeguarding the broadcast
                and the investments in it while you were cheering - or cursing.
            </p>
            <p>
                How does television translate to coding? I was part of a team. If I had to make a sports metaphor about
                my job, I was the goalie. When things got past me, everyone looked bad. I tried very hard not to let
                anything get past me with forethought and practice, right up until my last day. In later years it was
                easier to save more revenue. With a bit of clever log manipulation, late arriving commercials still
                aired. Move something sooner to create <em>just a bit more time</em> for delivery - which sometimes
                featured a promotions editor blasting into the room with a hard copy of content that was due to air in
                less than a minute. It was fun pulling off moments like that, although obviously - ideally - they
                should be rare occurrences.
            </p>
            <p>
                In recent years I had volunteered to work on an internal SharePoint Wiki that centralized information,
                standard practices and procedures. A sample of that work is available through the <a href="./portfolio.html">portfolio
                    page.</a> I tried to write organized, DRY html code with css, but I did it all with SharePoint's
                code editor. The SharePoint part was frustrating and yet the days I was scheduled to work on it flew by
                because I enjoyed the work so much. I have great passion for front end development and getting things
                <em>just right</em>. Sound hokey? It's not. It's what makes being downsized into my dream opportunity a
                chance to make lemonade!
            </p>
            <p>
                Since class has started - and with less than a month left - I've discovered that I very much enjoy
                working with APIs and databases on the back end, but I'm more comfortable on the front end and I have a
                pretty good knack for troubleshooting code. When class ends I'm going to dive into every project we did
                to make improvements and I'm looking forward to deep diving into the concepts we're covering at
                break-neck speed.
            </p>
            <p>
                The disclaimer to please be patient as my work gets more refined is in full force. I have plans for
                this site, so stay tuned.
            </p>
