                I was born and raised in Bismarck, North Dakota.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1995 I picked up my life and moved to Denver, Colorado. I've lived in Colorado for 23 years and love everything about it.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2017 I decided to enter the University of Denver's Full Stack Coding Bootcamp. I had been fiddling with coding for decades on my own and - in recent years - daydreaming about an opportunity like DU offered.

                This is a test for text wrap, featuring <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0x7yWXJl1g" target="_blank">Tom Servo's Moment of Silence:</a>

                God this is great, eh? This is so spiritual I just can't believe it. Heh Heh Heh. You know what this silence thing is like? Well, I'll tell you: I feel like one of them Trapper [sic] monks or something. Heh Heh. No kidding -- really. I feel so purified, my soul is as smooth as a baby's behind. HaHaHa. But I'm not just talking insights here -- no sir! I'm talking VISIONS! I'm talking FULL-BLOWN ILLUMINATIONS! I'm talking about revelations shouted down from the mountain tops!! I'm talking huge deafening thunderclaps of truth!! We're beyond mere silence here friends, we're into MEGA SILENCE! Heard about the big bang theory of silence? This is it man -- kaBOOM!!  HaHaHaHa. Boy, the quiet!! WOWIE! Is this silence or what?!? I feel enlightenment!! It's SATORI! It's like I'm sitting under the Bodhi Tree!!
