                I'm a <a href="https://bootcamp.du.edu/coding/full-time/" target="_blank">University of Denver</a> certified full stack web developer. I got a great overview of full stack through the program. I discovered that I very much enjoy working with APIs and databases on the back end, but I'm more comfortable on the front end and I have a pretty good knack for troubleshooting code.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since the course ended I've been looking for whoever will be smart enough to hire me ;) and <a href="https://github.com/RKaseman/RKaseman.github.io" target="_blank">revisiting the projects</a> we developed in class. One of the first things I've done is incorporate Handlebars templates on this site. Fitting, don't you think?

                It was especially useful on the portfolio page. Future updates to that page will be a breeze now!

                Meanwhile...
            </p>
            <p>
                I was born and raised in Bismarck, North Dakota.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1995 I picked up my life and moved to Denver, Colorado. <em>That</em> was a good decision, to say the least.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2017 I "decided" to enter the University of Denver's Full Stack Coding Bootcamp. I had been fiddling with coding for decades on my own and - in recent years - daydreaming about an opportunity like DU offered.
            </p>
            <p>
                I put the word decided in quotes above. After 21 years of being employed by a local television station, they decided they didn't need humans doing the job I did anymore and I was downsized -- into my dream opportunity.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the two decades I worked there I had my hands on all manner of broadcast technology. When I arrived on the scene it was paper logs and video tape machines. When I left the scene it was electronic logs and server-based program storage. I was at the controls for most of the Superbowl broadcasts during those two decades, including the most recent Denver Broncos Superbowl win. So yeah, that was me behind the controls safeguarding the broadcast and the investments in it while you were cheering - or cursing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Does television translate to coding? Yes. I always saw my job as getting everyone's work on the air the way <em>they</em> intended it. Doing that required consistent, quality communication and I was quick at picking up new technologies that arrived and getting the most out of them.
            </p>
            <p>
                In recent years I had volunteered to work on an internal SharePoint Wiki that centralized information, standard practices and procedures. A sample of that work is available through the <a href="./portfolio.html">portfolio page.</a> I tried to write good html and css, but I did it all with SharePoint's code editor which bloats code beyond all recognition. What you type into the html editor isn't what you get back when it's reopened. The SharePoint part was frustrating and yet the days I was scheduled to work on it flew by because I enjoyed the work so much. I have great passion for front end development and getting things <em>just right</em>. Coding keeps beckoning and being downsized into my dream opportunity is a chance to make lemonade!
