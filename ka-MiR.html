            <p>
                Months before I started coding bootcamp I worked on some of the lessons at <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/"
                    target="_blank">Khan Academy</a> for practice and preparation.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was quickly enamoured with processing.js.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although this project's title is "Make it Rain", I went the snow route because as I was coding it I
                thought slower falling motion was looking pretty cool. And about the snowman's head? It was a Khan
                Academy avatar. When I wrote my own page to feature it, I had to comment out the lines of code that
                called for it so it wouldn't stop the script from running. (Sorry, little guy!) It was a fun and
                coder-maddening challenge to get it from Khan Academy's lesson canvas onto my own page considering how
                much I didn't know at the time. The next step of this particular challenge is wiring start and stop
                buttons.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hang around for a minute to see the sparkles. I produced the effect quite by accident, and it's
                awesome. I was working on limiting the saturation of the snow effect and all of a sudden: sparkles!
