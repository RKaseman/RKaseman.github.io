                 Months before I started coding bootcamp I worked on some of the lessons at <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/" target="_blank">Khan Academy</a> for practice and preparation.
            </p>
            <p>
                 I was quickly enamoured with processing.js.
            </p>
            <p>
                 Although this project's title is "Make it Rain", I went the snow route because as I was coding it I thought slower falling motion was looking pretty cool. And about the snowman's head? It was a Khan Academy avatar. When I wrote my own page to feature it, I had to comment out the lines of code that called for it so it wouldn't stop the script from running. (Sorry, little guy!) It was a fun and coder-maddening challenge to get it from Khan Academy's lesson canvas onto my own page considering how much I didn't know at the time. The next step of this particular challenge is wiring the start and stop buttons.
            </p>
            <p>
                 Who can tell me why the sparkly effect happens? No one, yet. I produced it quite by accident, and it's awesome. I was working on limiting the saturation of the snow effect and all of a sudden: sparkles! If you're not seeing them, wait and watch a moment longer. On my computer it takes slightly over a minute to kick in.
