Welcome to my nook of GitHub.

There'll be a few non-functioning links until I get the chance to 
breathe and really focus on some of it. The University of Denver's 
Coding Bootcamp is fast and furious and it's been a great challenge 
to keep up, so that's where my energy has gone. As you'll see from 
banner titles, I have *plans* for my nook.
