[Evolution of a Coder](https://rkaseman.github.io/)

Welcome to my nook of GitHub.

I'm a front end coder especially fond of the standard languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I went through a coding bootcamp and since it ended I've been working on improvements to all of the projects we worked on in class, plus some previous coding work.
