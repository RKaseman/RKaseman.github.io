[Evolution of a Coder](https://rkaseman.github.io/)

Welcome to my nook of GitHub.

I'm a front end coder especially fond of the standard languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I got my certification through [The University of Denver's Full Stack Coding Boot Camp](https://bootcamp.du.edu/coding/full-time/) and since it ended I've been working on improvements to all of the projects we worked on in class. I'm also whipping previous coding work into shape. I have 4 years of experience coding HTML and CSS with Microsoft SharePoint for my previous employer.

## Complete (for now) projects:
