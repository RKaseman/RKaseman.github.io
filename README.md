[Evolution of a Coder](https://rkaseman.github.io/)

Welcome to my nook of GitHub.

I'm a [Coding with Kids](https://www.codingwithkids.com/#!/) instructor and front end coder especially fond of the standard languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (they can still do the job). I'm obsessed with [Processing.js](http://processingjs.org/) on the side.

I earned certification through [The University of Denver's Full Stack Coding Boot Camp](https://bootcamp.du.edu/coding/full-time/).

Since it ended I've been working on improvements to projects we worked on in class, tinkering with my personal site (like adding some [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/)), and whipping old coding work into modern enough shape to display.

I have 4 years of experience coding mainly HTML and CSS - with some basic Javascript - in Microsoft SharePoint for my previous employer.

#### I finally found my try at Javascript that goes with these files and added it to Sample 2:
