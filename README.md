[Evolution of a Coder](https://rkaseman.github.io/)

Welcome to my nook of GitHub.

I started working on fixes and improvements because bootcamp is over. I'm having a great time trying things and tweaking things and generally figuring out what I overlooked or didn't realize the first time through.

One of those things is how media queries cascade through the various sizes. That's one of the reasons I've spent a lot of time doing media query fixes and was able to eliminate a lot of redundant css code. It was also interesting to me that a css reset affects things like `<ol>`, `<strong>` or `<em>` tags and borders of tables, so I learned about "unset". That's useful.
