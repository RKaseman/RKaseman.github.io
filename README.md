[Evolution of a Coder](https://rkaseman.github.io/)

Welcome to my nook of GitHub.

I'm a front end coder especially fond of the standard languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm obsessed with [processing.js](http://processingjs.org/) on the side.

I got my certification through [The University of Denver's Full Stack Coding Boot Camp](https://bootcamp.du.edu/coding/full-time/). Since it ended I've been working on improvements to projects we worked on in class, tinkering with my personal site (like adding some [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/)), and whipping previous coding work into shape. I have 4 years of experience coding HTML and CSS with Microsoft SharePoint for my previous employer.

#### Complete projects...but not really because I'll _always_ find something to improve:
