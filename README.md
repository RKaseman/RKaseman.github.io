[Evolution of a Coder](https://rkaseman.github.io/)

Welcome to my nook of GitHub.

I'm a [Coding with Kids](https://www.codingwithkids.com/#!/) instructor and front end coder especially fond of the standard languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm obsessed with [processing.js](http://processingjs.org/) on the side.

I chose to apply for a position at Coding with Kids for more reasons than I'll list here, but one of the biggest is: it's a way to give back. Helping kids get a leg up is never a bad thing.

I earned certification through [The University of Denver's Full Stack Coding Boot Camp](https://bootcamp.du.edu/coding/full-time/). Since it ended I've been working on improvements to projects we worked on in class, tinkering with my personal site (like adding some [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/)), and whipping previous coding work into shape. I have 4 years of experience coding HTML and CSS with Microsoft SharePoint for my previous employer.
